## Testing Your Solutions

For each problem, test with:
1. **Valid inputs** - normal expected values
2. **Edge cases** - empty arrays, single element, max size
3. **Invalid inputs** - out of bounds, wrong data types
4. **Boundary conditions** - min/max values
5. **Real-world scenarios** - practical use cases

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solutions should demonstrate:
- [ ] Correct variable declarations and assignments
- [ ] Proper use of data types (int, float, etc.)
- [ ] Appropriate input/output operations
- [ ] Basic arithmetic and array operations
- [ ] Proper error handling for invalid inputs
- [ ] Clear and readable code with comments
- [ ] Meaningful variable names using snake_case

## Common Concepts to Practice

1. **Variables and Assignment**: Creating and modifying variables
2. **Data Types**: Working with numbers and arrays
3. **Input/Output**: Reading user input and displaying results
4. **Array Operations**: Traversal, modification, searching
5. **Arithmetic Operations**: Math calculations and comparisons
6. **Type Conversion**: Converting between data types
7. **Basic Error Handling**: Validating user input

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality, then add features
2. **Test Frequently**: Run your code often to catch errors early
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose variable names that explain their purpose
4. **Comment Your Code**: Explain complex logic with comments
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider what could go wrong with user input
6. **Format Output Nicely**: Make your programs user-friendly

## Next Steps

After completing these problems:
1. Review your solutions for improvements
2. Try optimizing your code for readability
3. Move on to Control Flow exercises
4. Practice combining multiple concepts

Remember: Programming is learned by doing. Write the code yourself, make mistakes, debug them, and learn from the process!
