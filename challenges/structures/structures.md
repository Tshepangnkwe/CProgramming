## Testing Your Solutions

For each problem, test with:
1. **Valid inputs** - normal expected values
2. **Edge cases** - empty structures, boundary values
3. **Invalid inputs** - out of range values, null data
4. **Boundary conditions** - maximum array sizes, data limits
5. **Real-world scenarios** - practical use cases and data

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solutions should demonstrate:
- [ ] Correct structure definition and initialization
- [ ] Proper member access using dot (.) operator
- [ ] Appropriate use of structure pointers and arrow (->) operator
- [ ] Efficient memory usage and data organization
- [ ] Proper input validation and error handling
- [ ] Clear and readable code with comments
- [ ] Meaningful variable and structure names using snake_case

## Common Concepts to Practice

1. **Structure Definition**: typedef, struct keyword usage
2. **Member Access**: Dot operator (.) for direct access
3. **Structure Pointers**: Arrow operator (->) for pointer access
4. **Structure Arrays**: Arrays of structure variables
5. **Nested Structures**: Structures within structures
6. **Structure Assignment**: Copying structure values
7. **Structure Parameters**: Passing structures to functions

## Tips for Success

1. **Design First**: Plan structure layout before coding
2. **Use typedef**: Simplify structure usage with typedef
3. **Initialize Properly**: Initialize all structure members
4. **Memory Alignment**: Understand structure padding
5. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear naming conventions
6. **Validate Input**: Check data validity before storing

## Next Steps

After completing these problems:
1. Review your solutions for improvements
2. Practice with file I/O and structures
3. Move on to advanced topics like unions
4. Practice combining structures with other concepts

Remember: Programming is learned by doing. Write the code yourself, make mistakes, debug them, and learn from the process!
